# Heart Disease Prediction (EDA + ML)

This repository contains a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning pipeline to predict heart disease. The notebook explores data, visualizes relationships, encodes features, compares models, and evaluates results.

What's included:
- heart_disease_EDA_ML.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with EDA, model comparison (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN, SVM), and evaluation.
- heart.csv - sample dataset (UCI-style heart disease data).
- requirements.txt - Python dependencies.
- .gitignore - files to ignore on GitHub.

How to run:
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. jupyter notebook heart_disease_EDA_ML.ipynb
